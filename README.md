GTTGUI
======

Quick GUI to make ships for GameThingTest

Notes
======

- You can select a background image under File -> Insert Image and choose to either have it streched or fit
- You can choose to have symmetry over the horizontal or vertical axis under the Edit menu
- You can have ruler lines under View to help with symmetry
- Pen color / anti aliasing can be customized under View menu as well. AA is really slow
- Once you have made a point you can select it in the pane on the right, press "Edit Point," tweak it, and save it again with the "Save" button
- Pens can be filled in too with the "fill" checkbox
- For multilayered models or making a low-edge count hitbox the current view can be exported with File -> Export Image. Restart GTTGUI and then use that bitmap in the background to help with your new layer
- When you are done go to File -> Show Code and copypasta it into the source like shown in GameThingTest

"Features"
======
- I don't think undo/redo actually do anything
- There is no way to delete a point
- The File -> New button dosen't really work all the way. Restart the app
- Try and find all the typos!
- If you don't specify a custom pen color it crashes
- Everything is misaligned
- The Vertical ruler dosen't draw
- Sometimes you have to click "Redraw" to get thing to show up



Enjoy!
